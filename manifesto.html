			<h1 class = "title">Personal Manifesto</h1>
			<h1 class = "mtitle">VISION, VIRTUES, AND VICTORY</h1>
			<p class = "content">I am guided by my clear purpose and driven by my vision of a life that aligns with my values, passions, and individuality. My journey may seem aimless at first, but I live while searching for growth, always looking inside and keeping myself balanced. This manifesto is a declaration to live a life that aligns with my aspirations while embracing the opportunities to grow, and connect with people around me.<br/><br/>
				I want to live with 3 core values in mind: authenticity, resilience, and balance. I want to stay true to myself, not being easily swayed by external pressures and others' definitions of success. I want to be able to embrace failure in order to be brave enough to stand up many times again. And I want to value joy through simple pleasures like running and quality time with my loved ones.<br/><br/>
				I strive to live my life unafraid of the uncertainties it brings, facing my fears and pursuing my goals in the way that I envision. Fairness guides me to treat others with equality, ensuring my actions are justified and deserved. Humility keeps me grounded, reminding me to acknowledge my flaws while committing to continuous self-improvement. <br><br/>
				My purpose is to live a fulfilling life. By blending introspection, curiosity, and adaptability, I aim to create meaningful connections and solutions that brings a positive impact to the world. In the short term, I seek to develop stronger communication skills to better articulate my ideas and emotions. After all, what is a great scientist when he is not understood. In the long-term, I aspire to have a career that is rooted in innovation, collaboration, and ethical action, which would allow me to serve others effectively. I face life with curiosity and an open mind, cultivating meaningful and supportive relationships while seeing challenges as opportunities for growth. My worldview balances individuality and connection, supported by fairness, respect, and a belief that humans are part of a greater whole, not the center of existence.
