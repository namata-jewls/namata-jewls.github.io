			<p class = "content">Self-reflection is not always easy but looking at how I view myself and how others perceive me has been very helpful. The activities and impressions revealed my ability to balance individuality with adaptability. Consequently, I now see myself as someone driven by clearness of purpose, something that people around me notice as well. Some friends even described me as inspiring, clear-headed, and practical. Apparently, I unconsciously project those qualities. <br/> <br/>
				I was also able to recognize the relation between individuality and connection. While the 20-Statements Test revealed that I often see myself in terms of personal attributes rather than physical traits or social roles, it’s clear that my relationships and environment also shape me. As a big brother, a friend, and a community member, I learned to see socialization as an important part of life. Moreover, even though I prefer working alone, I’ve learned to adapt and collaborate when needed, understanding that teamwork is inevitable in the real world and that it always leads to growth.<br/> <br/>
				Another interesting revelation I was able to discover was how people see my practical approach to setbacks. It feels natural to break problems down into smaller, solvable parts. Hearing it described as a “systems thinker” trait gave me a new perspective. Even though it’s something I intuitively do as a computer science student, knowing that others see it as a strength boosted my confidence. <br/> <br/>
				Body image is another area where I’ve seen this balance manifest. While I have always appreciated features like my legs and eyes, I did not expect my classmates to notice more masculine attributes like my abs or biceps. Their observations did not change how I see myself, but they did help in growing my positive perspective on self-improvement. It’s also somehow reassuring to know that I can value who I am while still being open to growth.<br/> <br/>
				Ultimately, these reflections go back to a single deeper truth that the self is a dynamic blend of internal qualities, and external and social interactions. I’ve realized that my individualistic nature, introspection, and adaptability work together to create the path I want to take in life. Everything connects, whether it’s my vision for the future, my problem-solving mindset, or my relationships. This reflection has shown me that I’m not just figuring things out—I’m growing, and I’m proud of the person I’m becoming.
