			<h1 class = "mtitle">KEEP CALM AND STAY HEALTHY</h1>
			<p class = "content">Health is more than just the absence of illness—it is the foundation of a holistic and balanced life. I make it a priority to stay active every day, focusing on movement that feels good for my body. I try my best to stick to a diet with nutritious foods and ensure I get enough rest to keep my energy levels stable. I believe that small, consistent actions are what truly build a healthy life, that is why I always aim for progress rather than perfection. When challenges come my way, I listen to my body and approach fatigue with humility and patience, using it as an opportunity to optimize my recovery and growth.<br/><br/>
				Just as important as my physical efforts is the time I spend socializing with others. I place a high value on building healthy and lasting relationships with friends and family, knowing that emotional support is crucial for anyone's overall well-being. I also make time to reconnect with nature. I find it essential in resetting my health, mentally and spiritually. Being down to earth helps me stay grounded and appreciate the small, everyday blessings, while mindfulness keeps me balanced and aware of my emotions. To keep my mind sharp and curious, I engage in creative and intellectual activities that challenge me and encourage lifelong learning.<br/><br/>
				This manifesto represents my commitment in prioritizing my health in all its forms—physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual. By living according to these principles, I aim to live a life where I approach each day with purpose, clarity, and joy, while always striving to improve.<br/><br/>
